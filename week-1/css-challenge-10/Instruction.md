Create a new repo called endOfWeek1

Create a feature branch (using the right conventions) to add a nav bar (on that branch proceed to follow the instructions as per screenshot attached)
Go through the right steps to get all your navBar changes onto your develop branch
From that updated develop branch create a new feature branch for a contact form
It should include first name, last name, age, email, message, state as a dropdown menu
All inputs should be on top of each other and nicely spaced.
Add colour styling to each inputs too
Go through the right steps to get all your Contact changes onto your develop branch
